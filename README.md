## What is Tribes 2?
> Tribes 2 is a first-person shooter multiplayer video game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in 2001 as a sequel to Starsiege: Tribes.

The game is abandonware and has a small but dedicated group of regular players.

Tribes 2 uses an early version of the Torque Game Engine (TGE) as its game engine and OpenGL as its rendering engine.

## What is Descension?
*Descension* is a cheat/hack I wrote for Midair: Community Edition (which has since rebranded to Midair 2). As the name suggests *Descension Ported To Tribes 2* is almost a one-to-one port of the original *Descension*.

You can view the repository for *Descension* at [https://github.com/MuhanjalaRE/Descension_MACE_UE4](https://github.com/MuhanjalaRE/Descension_MACE_UE4 "https://github.com/MuhanjalaRE/Descension_MACE_UE4").

You can view the repository for *Descension Ported To Tribes Ascend* (also another port of *Descension* for the video game Tribes: Ascend) at [https://github.com/MuhanjalaRE/DescensionPortedToTribesAscend](https://github.com/MuhanjalaRE/DescensionPortedToTribesAscend "https://github.com/MuhanjalaRE/DescensionPortedToTribesAscend")

- OBS bypass - Stream and recording proof when using game capture in OBS.

- Aimbot - Self explanetory.

- Triggerbot - Line up your crosshair with the aimassist markers for your weapon to automatically shoot (only works for single fire weapons).

- Menu - An actual menu/GUI for modifying settings and parameters easily

## How do I use this?
This cheat/hack is a Dynamic-link library (DLL). Once you have obtained the release binaries, use a DLL injector to inject the downloaded/compiled DLL (*DescensionPortedToTribes2.dll*) into the target process (*Tribes2.exe*).

### Keybinds
The following are the default keybinds. Feel free to modify them to your preference if compiling by source.

|  Key |  Function  | Information|
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|  INSERT |  Toggle menu | The menu can be used to modify the settings and parameters of the cheat/hack. |
| LEFT CONTROL | Reset target | This will only function If you have disabled the "Target everyone" setting in the aim assist tab of the menu. Pressing this key will reset the aim assist and choose a new target.|
|LEFT SHIFT| Activate aimbot | This will only function If you have disabled the "Target everyone" setting in the aim assist tab of the menu AND have a target selected. Pressing this key enable the aimbot and being tracking the target.|


## Can I get caught using this?
There is currently nothing server-side or client-side that can detect the use of this cheat/hack. However, you can be detected through manual means (such as someone spectating/observing you) which may lead to a ban.

If you're clever then you'll never have to worry about being caught. The only thing that can really causes suspicions is the aimbot. Don't be too blatant - ie. constantly flicking to targets and tearing everyone in the server apart.
